[JB BLOT - BOOK SEARCH APP](https://challenge21book.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
I've taken a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API and allows users to save book searches to the back end.
